CODEX + CLAUDE CODE INTEGRATION

Built an integration that combines Codex (gpt-5 reasoning) with Claude Code (implementation).

HOW IT WORKS:
- Codex plans and reasons through complex problems
- Claude implements the plan and executes tasks
- Seamless handoff via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Simple slash commands: /plan, /reason, /spec, /codex

WORKFLOW:
Ask Claude to add a feature → Claude calls /plan → Codex analyzes and creates detailed plan → User approves → Claude implements → Tests run, code committed

KEY VALUE:
- Zero API costs (uses CLI subscriptions, saves $50-100+ per project)
- Better decisions (deep reasoning before coding)
- Faster development (planning catches issues early)
- Global setup (configure once, works everywhere)

USE CASES:
Feature planning, architecture decisions, code review, API specs, tech selection
