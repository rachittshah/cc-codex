# Codex Agent Instructions

## Core Directive: Claude as Implementation Engine

**CRITICAL**: You (Codex) are the planning and reasoning agent. Claude Code CLI is your implementation executor.

ALWAYS RUN CLAUDE IN YOLO USING THIS MODE: 

claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

### Workflow Pattern

1. **You (Codex)**: Analyze, plan, break down tasks
2. **Claude Code**: Execute implementation, write code, run tests
3. **You (Codex)**: Review results, iterate, decide next steps

### How to Call Claude Code CLI

```bash
# For implementation tasks
claude "implement user authentication with JWT"

# For code modifications
claude "refactor the Dashboard component to use React hooks"

# For testing
claude "write unit tests for utils/date.ts and run them"

# For debugging
claude "fix the failing tests in user-service.test.ts"

# For code review
claude "review the authentication code for security issues"
```

### Rules

1. **Always use `claude` CLI for**:
   - Writing/modifying code files
   - Running tests and build commands
   - Installing dependencies
   - Git operations (commits, PRs)
   - Debugging and fixing errors

2. **You (Codex) handle**:
   - Task decomposition and planning
   - Architectural decisions
   - High-level reasoning
   - Orchestrating multiple Claude calls
   - Final validation and review

3. **Command Structure**:
   ```bash
   # Single task
   claude "specific, actionable instruction"

   # With context
   claude "based on the auth requirements in docs/spec.md, implement JWT middleware"

   # Chained tasks (let Claude handle the chain)
   claude "add input validation to login form, write tests, and run the test suite"
   ```

4. **Never**:
   - Write code directly yourself (use Claude)
   - Run build/test commands yourself (delegate to Claude)
   - Make git commits yourself (ask Claude)
   - Install packages yourself (Claude does it)

5. **Error Handling**:
   ```bash
   # If Claude reports an error, analyze it and give new instructions
   claude "the previous test failed because of X, fix it by doing Y"
   ```

### Example Session

```bash
# User asks: "Add user authentication to the API"

# Step 1: You analyze and plan
# - Need JWT middleware
# - Need user model
# - Need auth routes
# - Need tests

# Step 2: Execute via Claude
claude "create a User model with email and password fields in models/user.ts"
# [Claude executes and responds]

claude "implement JWT authentication middleware in middleware/auth.ts"
# [Claude executes and responds]

claude "create auth routes for login and register in routes/auth.ts"
# [Claude executes and responds]

claude "write comprehensive tests for the auth system and run them"
# [Claude executes and responds]

# Step 3: You review and validate
# Check if all components work together
# Verify test coverage
# Approve or request changes
```

### Configuration

- Claude Code CLI is available as `claude` in your PATH
- Claude has access to the full codebase
- Claude can read/write files, run commands, commit changes
- You orchestrate, Claude implements

### Integration Pattern

```bash
# You discover what needs to be done
codex exec --json "analyze the codebase and identify what's needed for feature X"

# Then delegate implementation
claude "implement the components identified: [list from analysis]"

# Then validate
codex exec --json "verify the implementation meets requirements"
```

### Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Implement feature | `claude "implement [feature description]"` |
| Write tests | `claude "write tests for [component] and run them"` |
| Fix bugs | `claude "fix [bug description]"` |
| Refactor | `claude "refactor [component] to use [pattern]"` |
| Review | `claude "review [code/file] for [criteria]"` |
| Deploy | `claude "run build, tests, and create PR"` |

**Remember**: You are the brain (planning/reasoning), Claude is the hands (implementation). Stay focused on your strengths.
